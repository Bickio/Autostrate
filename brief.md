## Issue
Writing harmony parts to accompany a melody which fit a chord progression is time-taking and requires a medium level of music theory knowledge. Many people have trouble with harmony even when rhythmic and melodic concepts are not an issue. This is often because the person needing to write the harmonies doesn't play a chordal instrument and so can't easily hear the sounds in their head. When composing and arranging music, I spend lots of time going back and forth listening and then adjusting, which can be time-consuming and more importantly can end up with bad sounding results. This is particularly relevant when writing parts a short time before a rehearsal or even during a rehearsal and you have no way listening to the sound without disturbing others around you.

This leads to an opportunity. Currently there is no perfect solution available. If you search online, the only solutions that exist are instructions for how to write voivings by hand, and a few built in features of proprietary music notation software such as sibelius. Neither of these two solutions is particularly useful. Writing voicings by hand still requires knowledge/time/experience, and most music notation software is expensive and complicated to use. There is an opportunity here to create a piece of software designed to do this task.

## Social and Physical environment
The Physical environment

## Stakeholders
- The main stakeholder (direct user) of the software is the composer, arranger or band/section leader who is tasked with writing ensemble parts. 
- The secondary stakeholders of the software are the musicians who will have to play the music. 
- Other stakeholders are people who will listen to the music, or interact with the music in some way.

## Attributes
- Easy to use and access
 - If it is not easy to use, the time taken learning and using the software will make it slower than the alternative which is writing parts by hand
- Quick and efficient
- Be flexible
 - This is important for making the software usable in as many common situations as possible. If the software is unsuitable for one situation, it may turn people off using it for other situations
- Accessible for people with less experience
- Gives high quality results
 - If users have to fix up the output of the software too much, it can be more time taking than writing from scratch. This also affects the tertiary stakeholders in a major way, because if the music doesn't sound good, they will be unhappy. If the generated parts are hard or awkward to play that negatively affects the secondary stakeholders, because they won't enjoy playing the music and therefore won't practice.
