## Issue
Writing harmony parts to accompany a melody which fit a chord progression is time-taking and requires a medium level of 
music theory knowledge. Many people I have talked to, and myself, have trouble writing harmony even when rhythmic and 
melodic concepts are not an issue. This is often because the person needing to write the harmonies doesn't play a 
chordal instrument and so can't easily hear the sounds in their head. When composing and arranging music, I spend lots 
of time going back and forth listening and then adjusting, which can be time-consuming and more importantly can end up 
with bad sounding results. This is particularly relevant when writing parts a short time before a rehearsal or even 
during a rehearsal and you have no way listening to the sound without disturbing others around you. Currently there is 
no perfect solution available. If you search online, the only solutions that exist are instructions for how to write 
voicings by hand, and a few built in features of proprietary music notation software such as sibelius. Neither of these 
two solutions is particularly useful. Writing voicings by hand still requires knowledge/time/experience, and most music 
notation software is expensive and complicated to use.

There is an opportunity here to create a piece of software designed to automate the process of writing orchestrations.

## Stakeholders
- The main stakeholder (direct user) of the software is the composer, arranger or band/section leader who is tasked with 
writing ensemble parts. 
- The secondary stakeholders of the software are the musicians who will have to play the music. 
- Other stakeholders are people who will listen to the music, or interact with the music in some way.

## Questions to ask stakeholders
1. Have you experienced the issue
2. Would you use a digital tool to speed up the process
3. What are the most important/useful features to have in such a product
4. What should I consider when designing making the product
5. What would you use it for and in what environment

## Considerations
- The software needs to be easy to use and access
    - If it is not easy to use, the time taken learning and using the software will make it slower than the alternative 
    which is writing parts by hand
- It must be quick and efficient
- It needs to be flexible
    - This is important for making the software usable in as many common situations as possible. If the software is 
    unsuitable for one situation, it may turn people off using it for other situations
- It should be accessible for people with less experience
- It needs to produce high quality results
    - If users have to fix up the output of the software too much, it can be more time taking than writing from scratch. 
    This also affects the tertiary stakeholders in a major way, because if the music doesn't sound good, they will be 
    unhappy. If the generated parts are hard or awkward to play that negatively affects the secondary stakeholders, 
    because they won't enjoy playing the music and therefore won't practice
- It should be easily maintainable
    - If the software is not easy to maintain from a development perspective, it won't be easy to develop and maintain,
    which will in turn affect how the software can change to reflect changes in stakeholder needs and it's ability to 
    solve more issues and fill more needs/opportunities in the future.
